                <strong><a href="/make-canned-atlas-template.html">Atlas Template Tool</a></strong> - Field Papers includes a HTML form based template API that you can host anywhere and populate with preset values for each use case. The form posts those parameters to Field Papers and populates each phase of the make atlas process with those values, while allowing the user to modify the area of interest, etc.

                <strong>Custom Map Styles</strong> - <a href="/upload_mbtiles.php">MBTiles Uploader Tool</a> - Use <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> to design your own basemap or leverage existing ArcGIS geodata via <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/">Arc2Earth</a> to export maps out of ArcMap in the MapBoxTiles SQLite data <a href="http://mapbox.com/mbtiles-spec/">format</a> and upload them for use on Field Papers. You'll need to be logged into Field Papers to save these to your account and have them available in the make atlas process.

                <strong>Custom Map Styles</strong> - <a href="/make-canned-atlas-template.html">TMS endpoints</a> - Already published your basemap online as a tiled map service? Use our template tool detailed above to point to the TMS endpoint. Example: <a href="http://tile.stamen.com/watercolor/{Z}/{X}/{Y}.jpg">http://tile.stamen.com/watercolor/{Z}/{X}/{Y}.jpg</a>.

                <strong>Edit in OSM</strong> - Field Papers plays well with others. If you upload a snapshot of your map at <a href="http://walkingpapers.org">Walking Papers</a>, you can use the tools there to edit OpenStreetMap in Potlatch and JOSM using your snapshot as a reference layer. Common tasks include adding streets, parks, building outlines, addresses, business names, and more.

                <strong>GIS Analysis</strong> - Need to perform advanced spatial analysis or add structured data? Download your notes in Esri Shapefile format (SHP) or GeoJSON (geographic projection) from each Atlas page. We also offer a GeoTIFF download (in web Mercator projection) of each atlas page snapshot, also from the Atlas page's activity stream. These files can be used in desktop applications like <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> or <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/index.html">ArcGIS</a>.

                <strong>Unstructured Text</strong> - FIeld Papers allows you to write notes about each feature when itâ€™s added to the map.

                <strong>Structured Data</strong> - Need to store structured form data about each map feature? Field Papers provides a large text field and you have two options: (a) use key:value pairs or (b) enter a uniqueID for a data join in a desktop GIS app with a worksheet of structured form data. An example of a <strong>key:value pair</strong> entered into the notes widget: type:park, name:Golden Gate, about:Large urban park with museums and buffalo. You can use another program outside of Field Papers to split those into separate columns. An example of a <strong>uniqueID</strong> is using a series of sequential numbers (1, 2, 3) entered into the notes widget like: 1. You'd fill out a separate stack of structured data "forms" about each feature in the field, marking the sequential uniqueID onto the map, onto it's form, filling out the form. Back at the computer, you'd add a note for each feature on Field Papers, noting the uniqueID. You'd transcribe the forms into a worksheet using OpenOffice or Excel noting both the uniqueID and the structured data about that feature. Download the GeoJSON or SHP from Field Papers, export your worksheet data, and use a program like <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> or <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/index.html">ArcGIS</a> to "join" the two together.
